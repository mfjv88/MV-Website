## Miguel Vacas's Website

Just the project repo to my website. I began this website when I was starting out with HTML, CSS and JS and to learn the ropes, so might not have the cleanest markup; any modifications was to continue testing new tools and to tidy up some of the HTML and CSS. Might be making a completely new one during the near future.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Although this is more of a personal project, any suggestions and recommendations are always welcome. I like to listen to new ideas or thoughts.

Just `npm i` and on forth.
